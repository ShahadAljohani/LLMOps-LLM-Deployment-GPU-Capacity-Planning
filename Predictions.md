fp16 is 2 bytes per parameter. 1.5B times 2 bytes is 3 GB of weights.

int8 is 1 byte per parameter, so 1.5 GB of weights.

int4 is about 0.5 bytes per parameter, so 0.75 GB of weights.

Loaded and resident on the GPU, add roughly 1.7–2.7 GB of overhead to each.

this model fit at fp32 (4 bytes per parameter) on a 15 GB T4, FP32 would be about 6 GB of weights, plus the runtime overhead, so it should fit within 15 GB.
